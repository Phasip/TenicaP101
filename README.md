TenicaP101
==========

Some code to display text on the TenicaP101 LED Display (95x7 pixels) using an Arduino mini 5v.
Wrote this to play with an Arduino mini and to find out how the TenicaP101 works.

TenicaP101 has 96 bits of memory, thus you push all data to display on one row, flash the row for a couple of ms then
redo for all other rows.
